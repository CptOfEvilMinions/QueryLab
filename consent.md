Affiliates of the QueryLab project and other representatives of this project may inspect a copy of your results. Upon completion of this data collection project, your personal data will be kept for no longer than three years, after which they will be erased.  If reports of studies resulting from your participation in this survey are published, or the results are presented at professional conferences, only group results or excerpts of individual data captures will be stated, without any reference to your personally identifying information.

No risks are anticipated from taking part in this research. If for any reason, at any time, you wish to stop participation in data collection for this research, you may do so without having to provide explanation and without affecting your relationship with the researchers.
