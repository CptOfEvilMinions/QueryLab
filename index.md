# What is Querylab?
QueryLab is a collaborative project between defenders and pen testers/red teamers. This project allows pen testers/red teamers to test their malware against OSQuery. This project has spent time currating OSquery rules to detect malware, check out [Test cases](test_cases.html). Below we provide two options to test your malware against OSquery.

## Option 1 - Community
[Kolide](https://kolide.com/) is the tool of choice for OSquery agent management. We have generated OSquery installs that will install OSquery and call back to a Kolide instance. If you choose this option, a report will be generated by the project maintainers about what they discovered. The malware authors have the choice to request additional detections to be added to there case.

The hope with this option is to increase the efficacy of OSquery to detect malware. Before accepting this option please read our [consent to research](consent.html) page.

## Option 2 - Paranoid
This project understands that the development time to create malware can be lengthy. Therefore, OSQuery configs are provided so that individuals can detonate their own malware and analyze it themselves.
